# Shoshin Code
A coding practice and mentorship platform that integrates coding exercises with an editor and repl, offers real-time session sharing across a network and session saving for any editor/exercise combination. A SPA that features ES6 evaluation, code highlighting, secure user authentication, WebSocket session streaming and exercises from the CodeWars API.

## Motivation
This app is born from a deep appreciation of online coding environments like [Repl.it](https://repl.it). A way of thinking, creating and building that started with the Unix time sharing systems of old is coming into its own in an incredible way: collaborative work across the network is how we're building the future. I find this way of building fascinating and want to understand it better. This is the first iteration of my effort in this regard. It's intended to be a learning experience not only in its building but in its use.

## To-do
 - [ ] Implement chat using Pusher Chatkit with WebSockets
 - [ ] Add read/write access toggling for 2nd party
 - [ ] Protect infinite loops
 - [ ] Experiment with replacing VM.js interpreter with Node.js, inspired by [olydis](https://github.com/olydis/node-in-browser/blob/master/README.md)
